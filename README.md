The repository contains different small applications and libraries that I use to test virtual computer network configurations.

Next technologies are used:
- C++ programming language;
- GNU Make utility;
- the [boost](https://www.boost.org/) C++ library;
- the [JSON C++ single header parser](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
